# Game Rewards Smart Contract

## Introduction
GameRewards is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables fair and transparent reward distribution for gaming achievements. The contract implements a straightforward points-to-rewards system where players can earn tokens based on their in-game performance.

The contract serves as a foundation for gaming platforms looking to implement blockchain-based reward systems with the following key features:
- Automated reward calculation based on game scores
- Secure point accumulation system
- Transparent reward claiming mechanism
